## 📊 SUBMISSION STRATEGY BREAKDOWN

### **Form-Based Submissions Found:**
✅ **3 Direct Forms:**
- ARTECHOUSE (Submittable platform - currently no open calls)
- MASS MoCA Studios (residency submissions)  
- High Museum (email-based exhibition proposals)

### **Email/Contact Based (Most Major Venues):**
📧 **47 Venues:** Use direct email or official contact channels
- Major museums (Whitney, MoMA, Guggenheim, etc.) = Curated programming, no open submissions
- International venues (ZKM, Centre Pompidou, Tate) = Curator contact required
- Established institutions = Professional relationship/gallery representation preferred

### **The Reality:**
🎯 **Top-tier venues** (Tier 1-2) rarely have open submission forms - they work through established networks, galleries, and curatorial relationships. **This is actually GOOD for you** because:
- Holly's existing track record (Bruce Museum, K Museum Seoul) = warm introductions possible
- Quality over quantity approach = higher success rate
- Professional email contact = shows understanding of industry protocols

**Recommendation:** Focus on the 5 confirmed contacts FIRST, then systematically work through others via direct curator outreach.
